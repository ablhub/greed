## Using Your Website

The GREED Inc. website features a modern single-page design with smooth scrolling navigation. Visitors land on an eye-catching hero section showcasing the greedy wolf mascot holding cash, surrounded by animated dollar signs that create a dynamic money-rain effect. The bright green "Buy on Pump.fun" button pulses with a glowing effect, inviting users to purchase tokens immediately. Social media icons for Twitter, Telegram, and Discord appear in vibrant green, allowing instant community access.

Scrolling down reveals the About section where visitors learn what makes GREED Inc. unique. The greedy wolf character in a business suit sits surrounded by gold coins and cash stacks, perfectly embodying the brand's bold personality. Four key benefits appear with animated icons showing massive gains potential, strong community support, fair launch credentials, and security guarantees with no team tokens and burned liquidity.

The Tokenomics section displays critical information in clean cards with green borders. Visitors see the one billion token total supply, one hundred percent fair launch distribution, and zero percent tax structure. A contract address appears with a "Copy" button that instantly copies the address to the clipboard and shows a success notification.

The Roadmap presents four phases in a vertical timeline with numbered green circles. Each phase card expands the current status from Q4 2025 launch through ongoing global domination plans. Progress indicators and checkmarks show completed milestones, while upcoming features display with rocket and fire emojis.

The How to Buy section breaks down the purchase process into four simple steps with large icons. Step one shows getting a Solana wallet like Phantom, step two covers buying SOL on exchanges, step three directs users to Pump.fun, and step four explains purchasing via the bonding curve. A second green "Buy Now on Pump.fun" button appears below the steps.

The Community section displays impressive statistics showing ten thousand plus members, five thousand plus holders, and one million plus market cap in bold green numbers. Three large buttons invite visitors to "Follow on X", "Join Telegram", and "Join Discord" with hover effects that fill the buttons with green.

The FAQ section features six common questions in expandable accordion cards. Clicking any question rotates the chevron icon and smoothly reveals the answer below. Questions cover what GREED is, rug pull concerns, buying instructions, unique features, moon predictions, and liquidity security.

The footer organizes links into four columns covering GREED Inc. information, quick navigation links, community platforms, and legal pages. A disclaimer clearly states this is a meme coin for entertainment purposes with investment risks. When scrolling down the page, a circular green button with an up arrow appears in the bottom right corner, instantly returning visitors to the top when clicked.
